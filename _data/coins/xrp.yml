notes: By default, rippled comes configured to point to a list of validators (UNL)  
  at https://vl.ripple.com (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/develop/cfg/validators-example.txt)
  operated by diverse parties. Currently Ripple only control 7/26 nodes (27%).
  Node operators can edit the config file to change this or choose their own
  list of validators, this list must contain a minimum overlap of 41% with the UNLs of the rest of the
  network, but has no requirement to include any Ripple servers at all.
