notes: By default, ripple only points to a list of only Ripple-operated validator
  nodes (currently 26) at https://vl.ripple.com (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/develop/cfg/validators-example.txt).
  Node operators would have to edit a config file to change this or choose their own
  list - hence only 1 entity owning consensus by default.
